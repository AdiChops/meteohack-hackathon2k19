            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>The ultimate goal of the application is to use numerous data sets in order to show Canadian citizens the whole economical, sociological and environmental picture of the effects of climate change. We plan on doing this by having users be able to complete challenges on different topics. Example topics include, forest fires, flooding, sea level rise, ocean acidification and so on. Each challenge would contain questions and data sets relating to the topic. If we were to use forest fires for an example, we can find data sets about the increasing costs, frequency and effects on air quality.   </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>In order to incentivize Canadian citizens to use the app and learn about the effects climate change can have, each challenge will come with a completion bonus resulting in points, or 'Envirobucks'. Once a user has enough Envirobucks they would be able to redeem them for merchandise supplied by partner companies. Companies can use this as part of their environmental responsibility by offering merchandise or gift cards. Envirobucks could be converted into tax credits to incentivize a wider population. </p>
